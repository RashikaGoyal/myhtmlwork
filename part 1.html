<p>There was once a <a href="leopardroar.mp3.mp3">leopard</a> in the <a href="jungle.mp3">jungle</a>; and a very nocturnal leopard he was too. He could hardly <a href="sleep.mp3">sleep</a> at night and, lying on a branch of his magnificent tree, he spent his time watching what was happening in the forest at night. This is how he came to learn that there was a thief in that <a href="nightforest.mp3">forest</a>. He would watch the thief go out every night with empty hands and return loaded up with his stolen loot. Sometimes the thief had nabbed the senior <a href="monkey.mp3">monkey's</a> bananas, other times he had filched the <a href="lionroar.mp3">lion's</a> wig, or pinched the zebra's stripes. One night he even snuck home with the big <a href="elephant.mp3">elephant's</a> false tusk, which the elephant had been secretly wearing for quite some time.
